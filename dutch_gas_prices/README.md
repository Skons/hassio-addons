Get the latest gas prices from dutch gas stations.

## About

This addon retreives the latest gas prices from dutch gas stations and sends those prices to an MQTT broker. It is possible to get prices for specific gas stations, or to get prices from gas stations within a certain radius. The data is acquired from https://directlease.nl/tankservice/, but it is only available as an image. Tesseract is used to process those images, so there is no guarantee that the data is correct. The concept is based upon https://github.com/sanderdw/Dutch-Gas-prices-API.

This addon can work on a RPi3, please see known issues in the docs for more information.
